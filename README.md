We could improve our alerting and tracking through a range of methods:

1. We could use alerting tools like PagerDuty or Datadog, which can define the level of severity for our alerts and send notifications out to the proper teams to fix the errors. This is useful for getting thr right people online quickly, and can streamline the process of identifying the individuals managing a project. As such its great for its ability to handle incident responses.

2. We could also manage our ticketing of issues with software like Jira, Asana, and Trello. These allow us to categorize our issues by our chosen metrics: severity, progress-level, etc. It streamlines the process of managing the workload, assigning tasks, and tracking the completion of the solutions.
